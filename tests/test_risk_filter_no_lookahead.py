"""Look-ahead audit for the decision-time CVaR filter (P5 acceptance check).

Non-negotiable per PLAN_P5_make_the_constraint_bind.md: a filter that peeks at
future returns would invalidate every result built on it. Two independent
checks:

1. ``precompute_filter_state`` -- corrupting returns strictly AFTER step t
   must not change the trailing covariance, mean, or anchor computed AT t.
2. ``cvar_filter_step`` -- given identical trailing statistics and an
   identical proposed action, the filter's decision (shrink factor and
   filtered weights) is a pure function of those trailing statistics; it
   takes no other input, so if (1) holds, the full decision at t is provably
   unaffected by anything at or after t.
